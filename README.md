## Investment portfolio CLI tool

### Motivation

- Practice node basics

### Functionality

Right now can only

- Add a new holding to **src/portfolio.json**
- Print an existing holding

### Run on your local machine

It's not (yet) very useful... but to run on your machine (assuming you have node installed) you'd need to

1. Get the code
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `node src/index.js --help` to view the available commands.
